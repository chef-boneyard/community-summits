# Community Summit Notes

This [wiki](https://github.com/chef/community-summits/wiki) is used to collect the discussion notes from the open spaces sessions held during the community summits.

## Taking Note?
If you have offered to take the notes for your session `Congratulations` :) Please follow the link below to your summit landing page and then on to your discussion page.

_If either of those links don’t exist first time round please feel free to create them using this suggested format, make sure to leave a breadcrum so other vistors can find your contribution._
